## My process
This was fun and simple. I didn't use any special CSS feature to complete this task. My reson for this is I was just trying to show off how the web is already responsive wihtout anything added to the code. CSS is amazing and I beleive that 99% of builds on the web need to stat with mobile first becuase the web is already responsive. 

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties


This has become one of my favporite thing to do so far in CSS. I'm not sure why but learning CSS before I used to use the link. Now I find myself using Font-Face a lot more and its easier to use for me.
```CSS
@font-face {
    font-family: 'outfit';
    src: url('assets/Outfit/Outfit-Regular.woff2') format('woff'),
    url('assets/Outfit/Outfit-Bold.woff2') format('woff2');
}
```

### Useful resources

- [Cloud Convert](https://cloudconvert.com/ttf-to-woff2) - This is a cool resource for anyone who use font-face and would like to convert ttf files to woff2 font.
